### Persisting Data in Kubernetes ###


Step 1: Creating A Pod For The Nginx Application


![1](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/23.-Pesisting-Data-in-Kubernetes/assets/79456052/98fafcff-b553-40bc-83ed-3c893bf4a763)

Apply the manifest with the help of kubectl `kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml`

Get an output of the pods running in the cluster by running the command `kubectl get pods`

To see other fields introduced by kubernetes after you have deployed the resource, simply run below command, and examine the output. 
You will see other fields that kubernetes updates from time to time to represent the state of the resource within the cluster. -o simply means the output format.

`kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml`

`kubectl describe pod nginx-pod`

STEP 2: Accessing The Nginx Application Through A Browser
Try to accessing the Pod through its IP address from within the K8s cluster. To do this, We need an image that already has curl software installed.

Run kubectl to connect inside the container `kubectl run curl --image=dareyregistry/curl -i --tty`


Run curl and point to the IP address of the Nginx Pod (Use the IP address of your own Pod) `# curl -v 10.244.0.3`

Now Let's try and access the application through the browser, but first we need to create a service for the Nginx pod.
Create a Service yaml manifest file: `kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml`

nginx-service.yaml manifest file

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-pod 
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
```


Create a nginx-service resource by applying your manifest `kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml`


Check the created service `kubectl get service`

Since the type of service created for the Nginx pod is a ClusterIP which cannot be accessed externally, we can do port-forwarding in order to bind the machine's port to the ClusterIP service port, i.e, tunnelling traffic through the machine's port number to the port number of the nginx-service: $ kubectl port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80

Accessing the Nginx apllication from the browser: http://localhost:8089

Another way of accessing the Nginx app through browser is the use of NodePort which is a type of service that exposes the service on a static port on the node’s IP address and they range from 30000-32767 by default. Edit the nginx-service.yml manifest file to expose the Nginx service in order to be accessible to the browser by adding NodePort as a type of service:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx-pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

Accessing the nginx application from the browser with the value of the nodeport 30080 which is a port on the node in which the Pod is scheduled to run:http://localhost:30080

![7a  The part where the localhost is forwarded to port 30080 worked now](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/22.-Deploying-Applications-Into-Kubernetes-Cluster/assets/79456052/4bd24601-f631-4f4c-a668-a8cc72291d1f)


Step 3: Create a Replicaset

The replicaSet object helps to maintain a stable set of Pod replicas running at any given time to achieve availability in case one or two pods dies.
Deleting the nginx-pod: `kubectl delete pod nginx-pod`
Creating the replicaSet manifest file and applying it: `$ kubectl apply -f rs.yaml`

run the command  `kubectl apply -f rs.yaml`
